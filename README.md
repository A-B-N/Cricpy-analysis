# Cricpy-analysis


This repository will have the player analysis performed by me using the cricpy python package.

The package has some cool function that performs various analysis starting from basic to expert level.

The package collects real-time data from ESPN Cricinfo and currently supports only Test Cricket. 

It can be installed using : 

pip install cricpy


In this repository, I have done the analysis of Virat Kohli's batting using the various functions available in this package.

More analysis to be done in future.
